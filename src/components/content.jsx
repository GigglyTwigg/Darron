  profile:"Game Development has always been a part of my life, I have been building battle fields and creating worlds for people to adventure in for as long as I can remember. Developing games is a true passion and love of mine. I am an analytical person and really enjoy coding and fault finding, almost like a puzzle in itself. Every game I make I try to use a new feature or something i have not done before. I enjoy learning how to use and apply it, and in the game dev world i have endless things to learn, perfect, and create.",
  aboutMore:"I Love game development and aspire to find a place where I can grow! My main love is the coding and mechanics but that does not mean I have any less interest or passion in everything else, from 3D modeling to animation, I am here to learn and I will impress. Teach me to code and I will code you Apps, teach me to animate and I will make you a Movie, teach me the intricacies and I will make you a GAME!!!"
